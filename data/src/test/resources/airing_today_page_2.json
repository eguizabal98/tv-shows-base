The opening sequence for the series has remained the same throughout the decades, which remains highly unusual for any such long-running TV series up to date.\n\nEach of the regional TV channels which together form ARD, plus ORF and SF, produces its own episodes, starring its own police inspector, some of which, like the discontinued Schimanski, have become cultural icons.\n\nThe show appears on DasErste and ORF 2 on Sundays at 8:15 p.m. and currently about 30 episodes are made per year. As of March 2013, 865 episodes in total have been produced.\n\nTatort is currently being broadcast in the United States on the MHz Worldview channel under the name Scene of the Crime.",
